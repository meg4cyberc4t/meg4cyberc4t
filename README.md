Hello! I’m Igor ([ˈiɡərʲ]), a mobile application developer specializing in Flutter. I have a keen interest in
microservices architecture, programming language constructs, team building, and public speaking. Lately I've
been into compilers.

During my working hours, I work on <a href="https://github.com/meg4cyberc4t?tab=repositories">projects</a> and
<a href="https://pub.dev/publishers/molchanovia.dev/packages">public libraries</a>, and in my free time I run a
<a href="https://www.t.me/meg4cyberc4t">telegram channel</a>.
